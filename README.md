# PirateAI
Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

We were given most of the code, but had to develop the main logic. I created the logic for how the pirate behaves at each epoch and what the pirate does when the game is won or not. If it meets a >90% win rate the model will consider it a win, if not the pirate will keep running through the loop again to try and improve.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists work with all aspects of computers, generally software. This includes things like web development, data analysis, security software creation, etc. Our society is so connected to technology that we need it to be functional to maintain our way of life. We rely on the technology to do just about everything, from the average person to government operations.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist I approach problems by first understanding the requirements and resources availible. Then, I begin breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts. Next, I design solutions for each smaller segment. I test them and iterate until the desired results are reached. I then add it all together as an efficient solution for the problem.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Ethical responsibilities are very important when handling technology. The end user expects privacy, i.e. their personal health/location/family data. It is your job as a developer to ensure as little data as possible is taken and it is handled appropriately. It is important to keep organizations' data secure as well, due to them possibly having trade secrets or them having individuals private data.
